This code is for the scene with functions assignment for Code in Place 2025

" We expect you to:
Call draw_cloud two more times to match the picture. Don't worry about getting the x and y position exactly right.

Write a function draw_tree that draws a single tree. The bottom of the trunks should be at TREE_BOTTOM_Y. Don't worry about getting the x position exactly right, but make sure you can easily place several trees at different positions by making several calls to draw_tree.

Make the trunk of the trees a rectangle that's TRUNK_WIDTH wide and TRUNK_HEIGHT tall. Use a circle to represent the leaves of the trees that is LEAVES_SIZE wide.

Feel free to color your clouds and trees however you like, just make sure you can easily color them all differently."
